# StructuralCoherence

This repository contains the source code, datasets, and plotting scripts for the analysis presented in the paper **[Insert Your Paper Title Here]**.

## Repository Structure

The code is organized into two main directories:

### 1. `CohMat/`
This folder focuses on the **analysis of artificial networks**.
* **Contents:** Analysis scripts, source data, and plotting codes.
* **Key Output:** Visualizations and metrics related to artificial network structures.

### 2. `AbasyAnalysis/`
This folder contains the analysis for **whole-organism Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN)** and **iModulon** data.
* **Contents:** Scripts for processing whole-organism data and generating iModulon-related insights along with plots.

---

## Data Availability

Each main directory (`comat` and `Abasy`) contains a `data/` subfolder holding the necessary input files for the scripts.

**Note on Large Files:**
Due to GitHub's file size limits, datasets larger than 100MB are **not included** in this repository.
* All data files under 100MB are available in their respective `data/` folders.
* **Missing large files:** Any missing large datasets must be generated locally using the provided generation scripts.
